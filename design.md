# Assets Design

Luther/Cassia was given two geos by their parents when they were five years old. Today, the two are missing somewhere in Undertown. Maybe the residents of Undertown can help them find the mischievous pair.

Geo: Geometric
Collectible creatures to befriend, care for, and battle. Their appearances consist of regular lines and shapes. They are responsible for mining and gathering ores.

Fig: Figure
Humanoid creatures that fulfill communal and economic roles to help, befriend, battle against, and compete with. Their appearances consist of points, lines, and planes. A secondary species that has taken to caring for geos and recurs who provide them the charges they need as sustenance.

Recur: Recursive
Humanoid creatures that manage and protect the creatures of an area to help, befriend, and respect. Their appearances consist of patterns recurring on increasingly smaller scales, or rather fractals. Given ores by geos, they break these ores down, extract and so produce charges.
